WEBVTT - Adidas v Puma: A Battle of Boots and Brothers

0:00:15.410 --> 0:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Pushkin. The mayor of Hertzogenarak is going to watch a

0:00:23.810 --> 0:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>game of soccer. On one foot, he wears a shoe

0:00:27.170 --> 0:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>made by Adidas. On the other foot, a shoe made

0:00:31.210 --> 0:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>by Puma. If you didn't know anything about Hurtzegenarak, you

0:00:36.410 --> 0:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>might assume that the mayor must be unobservant, disorganized, a

0:00:41.210 --> 0:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>little absent minded, not a bit of it. The mayor

0:00:45.530 --> 0:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>of Hrzegenarak chose his footwear carefully. He's a diplomat. He

0:00:52.610 --> 0:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>has to be. Hertzegenarak is a small town on the

0:00:58.170 --> 0:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Arak River in Bavaria, Germany, with a history that traces

0:01:02.890 --> 0:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>back a thousand years. Its population just twenty four thousand.

0:01:08.850 --> 0:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>The old town is picture postcard perfect. Cobbled streets and

0:01:13.690 --> 0:01:18.850
<v Speaker 1>medieval half timbered buildings are restored thirteenth century castle, a

0:01:18.890 --> 0:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>barock church, ivy climbing up the clock tower, and a fountain.

0:01:24.250 --> 0:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>A fountain with a modern statue depicting two groups of

0:01:27.850 --> 0:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>children playing a childhood game tug of war. Look closely

0:01:34.330 --> 0:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see the children on one end of the

0:01:36.490 --> 0:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>rope are in Puma shoes, the other team Adidas. This

0:01:43.530 --> 0:01:47.410
<v Speaker 1>small town in Bavaria is home to the headquarters of

0:01:47.490 --> 0:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>not one, but two global behemoths of sports apparel, Adidas

0:01:53.130 --> 0:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>and Puma, between them sell over thirty billion dollars worth

0:01:57.690 --> 0:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>of clothes and shoes and equipment every year. For decades,

0:02:02.930 --> 0:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Herzogenarach has had a Puma side of the river and

0:02:07.130 --> 0:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>an Adidas side, a Puma sponsored local soccer team and

0:02:12.410 --> 0:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>an Adidas team, Puma families and Adidas families. The town

0:02:18.530 --> 0:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>of the Lowered Games, it was called because people then

0:02:22.370 --> 0:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Hurtzognarach would glance down to check the brand of your

0:02:26.690 --> 0:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>footwear before deciding how to greet you. The mayor grew

0:02:36.090 --> 0:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>up in a Puma family. As a kid, he says,

0:02:39.770 --> 0:02:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I had only Puma clothes. Wearing Adidas would have been unthinkable. Now,

0:02:46.170 --> 0:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>as a politician, he wears both brands, admittedly not usually

0:02:51.370 --> 0:02:54.970
<v Speaker 1>one on either foot. But today is a special day

0:02:55.810 --> 0:03:01.850
<v Speaker 1>September twenty first, two thousand and nine United Nations World

0:03:01.970 --> 0:03:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Peace Day, to mark the occasion workers from Adidas and

0:03:06.850 --> 0:03:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Puma are going to play a game of soccer. It

0:03:10.890 --> 0:03:14.970
<v Speaker 1>would have been impossible thirty years ago, says the mayor.

0:03:15.930 --> 0:03:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not Puma versus added as that might be pushing

0:03:19.330 --> 0:03:24.690
<v Speaker 1>the tentative datantes too far. Instead, each team has players

0:03:24.690 --> 0:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>from both companies. One team wears white, the other black.

0:03:29.890 --> 0:03:33.050
<v Speaker 1>The specially made shirts have the three stripes of Addedas

0:03:33.050 --> 0:03:38.370
<v Speaker 1>on one sleeve Puma's Leaping Cat on the other. We

0:03:38.650 --> 0:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>play for peace, the CEO of Puma tells assembled journalists.

0:03:44.090 --> 0:03:50.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a historical moment, adds the CEO of Adidas. It's

0:03:50.530 --> 0:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>the kind of rhetoric usually reserved for peace talks in

0:03:54.530 --> 0:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East. How did the choice of leisure wear

0:03:58.250 --> 0:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>in a small town in Bavaria becomes such a serious affair.

0:04:04.250 --> 0:04:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm Tim Harford, and you're listening to cautionary tales. This

0:04:34.810 --> 0:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>is a tale about motivation at work, what it can achieve,

0:04:39.730 --> 0:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>and the strange places it can take us when it

0:04:42.730 --> 0:04:47.730
<v Speaker 1>goes too far. The story starts in nineteen eighteen with

0:04:47.810 --> 0:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>a young man coming home from the First World War,

0:04:51.650 --> 0:04:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Adolph Dassler Addie to his friends. ADDIE's dad was a weaver.

0:04:58.650 --> 0:05:01.730
<v Speaker 1>His mum washed people's linens in the shed in their yard,

0:05:02.690 --> 0:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>but in the hardship of war, not many people could

0:05:05.850 --> 0:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>afford to outsource their laundry. Returned to Herzegenauach to find

0:05:11.570 --> 0:05:15.410
<v Speaker 1>his mother's laundry shed shuttered and he decided to start

0:05:15.450 --> 0:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>his own business there, making shoes. There was plenty of

0:05:21.210 --> 0:05:25.410
<v Speaker 1>leather to be scavenged from old army kits, helmets and

0:05:25.490 --> 0:05:29.770
<v Speaker 1>bags no longer needed. Addie collected them, cut them up

0:05:29.810 --> 0:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>into strips, and stitched them into boots. The electricity kept

0:05:34.450 --> 0:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>cutting out, so Addie invented a bicycle powered device to

0:05:38.650 --> 0:05:42.650
<v Speaker 1>work the leather. He got a friend to pedal. Addie

0:05:42.730 --> 0:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>had never been trained as a cobbler, but he was

0:05:45.250 --> 0:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>a keen athlete, a runner, a high jumper, and he

0:05:48.810 --> 0:05:52.730
<v Speaker 1>understood how hard it was to find good footwear for sports.

0:05:53.570 --> 0:05:56.330
<v Speaker 1>The state of the art in running spikes was simply

0:05:56.650 --> 0:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>leather soles with nails banged through them. Addie was sure

0:06:00.370 --> 0:06:05.290
<v Speaker 1>he could do better. He spent hour after hour experimenting

0:06:05.330 --> 0:06:10.090
<v Speaker 1>with different kinds of spike and studs for soccer. His

0:06:10.170 --> 0:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>shoes started to sell and he moved from the shed

0:06:13.770 --> 0:06:18.570
<v Speaker 1>into a factory. His older brother joined the business. Rudy

0:06:18.650 --> 0:06:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Dassler was a sportsman too, nicknamed the Puma, but in

0:06:24.570 --> 0:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>other ways he wasn't like Addie at all. Addie liked

0:06:28.890 --> 0:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>to tinker alone at his work bench. Rudy was suave

0:06:32.930 --> 0:06:38.290
<v Speaker 1>and loud and confident, a natural salesman. By nineteen thirty three,

0:06:38.770 --> 0:06:42.730
<v Speaker 1>when Hitler came to power in Germany, the Dassler brothers

0:06:42.850 --> 0:06:47.330
<v Speaker 1>were employing seventy people, and the Nazis seemed like they

0:06:47.410 --> 0:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>might be good for the sports shoe business. In Maine,

0:06:52.210 --> 0:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>camp Hitler dreamed of six million supremely fit athletes, all

0:06:58.290 --> 0:07:03.130
<v Speaker 1>suffused with the supreme love of the fatherland. Addie and

0:07:03.210 --> 0:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Rudy joined the Nazi Party. They put out an advert

0:07:08.170 --> 0:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>showing a blonde haired runner. Dassler sports shoes praised by

0:07:13.610 --> 0:07:19.250
<v Speaker 1>all who try them. Sales started to boom, and the

0:07:19.290 --> 0:07:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Olympics were coming to Berlin in nineteen thirty six. Hitler

0:07:24.210 --> 0:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>hoped the games would show the superiority of Aryan athletes.

0:07:29.810 --> 0:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>But there was a problem with that hope, and his

0:07:33.090 --> 0:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>name was Jesse Owens, a twenty two year old black

0:07:37.330 --> 0:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>man born in Alabama, the son of a sharecropper, and

0:07:42.090 --> 0:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>the fastest sprinter the world had ever seen. Some in

0:07:47.010 --> 0:07:51.570
<v Speaker 1>America wanted to boycott the Nazi Games, but Jesse was

0:07:51.690 --> 0:07:56.210
<v Speaker 1>keen to compete. I wanted no part of politics, Jesse

0:07:56.370 --> 0:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>later explained. Addie Dassler felt much the same. Sport is

0:08:02.650 --> 0:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>my politics, he said. As for the rest, I've really

0:08:06.690 --> 0:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>got no interest in it at all. Addie couldn't care

0:08:11.250 --> 0:08:15.010
<v Speaker 1>less about arians winning gold medals. He just wanted to

0:08:15.050 --> 0:08:18.970
<v Speaker 1>see what the world's fastest runner thought of his shoes.

0:08:20.130 --> 0:08:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So Addie finds his way into the Olympic village and

0:08:23.970 --> 0:08:28.170
<v Speaker 1>seeks out Jesse Owens. He produces a pair of his

0:08:28.570 --> 0:08:34.010
<v Speaker 1>latest design. They have cushioned heels and angled spikes, and

0:08:34.050 --> 0:08:39.210
<v Speaker 1>their light just six ounces. The shoemaker from Bavaria can't

0:08:39.330 --> 0:08:44.410
<v Speaker 1>easily communicate with the athlete from Alabama, but with smiles

0:08:44.450 --> 0:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>and gestures, Addie persuades Jesse to try the shoes and

0:08:49.450 --> 0:08:53.410
<v Speaker 1>keep them if he likes them. In a stadium clad

0:08:53.490 --> 0:08:57.610
<v Speaker 1>with swastikas, Jesse Owens lines up for the one hundred

0:08:57.650 --> 0:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>meter final. He's in the inside lane. In just a

0:09:01.810 --> 0:09:06.130
<v Speaker 1>few strides, he powers clear. The runners behind him grimace

0:09:06.210 --> 0:09:15.770
<v Speaker 1>and strain, but they can't get close. Jesse Owens wins

0:09:15.850 --> 0:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>the one hundred meters, then he wins the two hundred meters,

0:09:20.410 --> 0:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>and the relay and the long jump. A black man

0:09:25.210 --> 0:09:29.450
<v Speaker 1>is the star of the Nazi Olympics, and the television

0:09:29.530 --> 0:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>pictures showed Jesse wearing his Dassler brother's shoes with the

0:09:34.690 --> 0:09:39.410
<v Speaker 1>two distinctive strips of leather down the side. For the brothers,

0:09:39.610 --> 0:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>it's great publicity, but at home not all is well.

0:09:45.210 --> 0:09:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Shoemaker Addie and salesman Rudy and their spouses and children

0:09:50.290 --> 0:09:53.490
<v Speaker 1>all live in the same big house, and as the

0:09:53.610 --> 0:09:57.410
<v Speaker 1>nineteen thirties draw to a close, it seems that Rudy

0:09:57.930 --> 0:10:01.930
<v Speaker 1>is not getting on with ADDIE's much younger wife. She's

0:10:02.010 --> 0:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>sticking her nose into business decisions, he complains. One night,

0:10:07.050 --> 0:10:11.570
<v Speaker 1>early in the Second World War, the air raid siren sounds.

0:10:12.490 --> 0:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Rudy and his family are already in the bunker when

0:10:15.650 --> 0:10:20.290
<v Speaker 1>ADDIE's family arrive. Rudy hears Addie mutter to his wife

0:10:21.010 --> 0:10:25.690
<v Speaker 1>those bastards to hear again the British bombers. Addie insists

0:10:25.690 --> 0:10:30.450
<v Speaker 1>that he meant, but Rudy won't be persuaded. He's sure

0:10:30.570 --> 0:10:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Addie meant him an unforgivable insult. At least, that's one

0:10:36.970 --> 0:10:39.890
<v Speaker 1>story that later gets told about the origins of the

0:10:39.930 --> 0:10:45.690
<v Speaker 1>brothers falling out. There is another. ADDIE's away for three

0:10:45.770 --> 0:10:50.290
<v Speaker 1>months on military service. Rumor has it that Rudy and

0:10:50.530 --> 0:10:57.650
<v Speaker 1>ADDIE's wife start an affair a misunderstanding or a marital infidelity.

0:10:58.450 --> 0:11:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the reason, the brothers now can't stand each other,

0:11:03.290 --> 0:11:06.250
<v Speaker 1>and each becomes convinced that the other is trying to

0:11:06.250 --> 0:11:09.410
<v Speaker 1>get them off the scene. As the author Barbara Smit

0:11:09.770 --> 0:11:15.610
<v Speaker 1>describes in her book Sneaker Wars, Addie soon gets discharged

0:11:15.650 --> 0:11:19.410
<v Speaker 1>from the army. He persuades the Nazi bosses that his

0:11:19.530 --> 0:11:22.610
<v Speaker 1>factory can make useful goods for the war instead of

0:11:22.690 --> 0:11:27.370
<v Speaker 1>just sports shoes, and the factory can't run without him. Now,

0:11:27.730 --> 0:11:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Rudy gets called up, and try as he might, he

0:11:31.450 --> 0:11:35.010
<v Speaker 1>can't talk his way out of it. He's convinced that

0:11:35.210 --> 0:11:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Addie is pulling some strings to keep him away from

0:11:38.170 --> 0:11:43.570
<v Speaker 1>their business. In nineteen forty five, with the Allies closing in,

0:11:44.170 --> 0:11:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Rudy tries to slip away in the chaos, but no

0:11:48.090 --> 0:11:51.130
<v Speaker 1>sooner has he got back home than the Gestapo come

0:11:51.170 --> 0:11:55.730
<v Speaker 1>and arrest him. After the war finally ends, he turns

0:11:55.810 --> 0:12:00.850
<v Speaker 1>up again. My brother and his wife were unpleasantly surprised.

0:12:01.250 --> 0:12:05.530
<v Speaker 1>He said they had not thought I would return. The

0:12:05.570 --> 0:12:11.250
<v Speaker 1>war is over, but the recriminations are not. Soon Rudy

0:12:11.370 --> 0:12:15.690
<v Speaker 1>is arrested again, this time by the Americans. They seem

0:12:15.770 --> 0:12:20.250
<v Speaker 1>to think Rudy might have committed war crimes. Rudy is

0:12:20.290 --> 0:12:23.890
<v Speaker 1>sure he knows who gave them that idea. He spends

0:12:23.930 --> 0:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>a year in an internment camp before the Americans decide

0:12:28.650 --> 0:12:33.450
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough evidence and let him go. Addie is

0:12:33.450 --> 0:12:38.810
<v Speaker 1>in danger too. A local de nazification committee has to

0:12:38.890 --> 0:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>decide how enthusiastic a Nazi he was. He stands to

0:12:43.970 --> 0:12:49.450
<v Speaker 1>lose his business. Addie protests, I wasn't that enthusiastic. He

0:12:49.570 --> 0:12:52.450
<v Speaker 1>joined the party, he says, only because it might help

0:12:52.530 --> 0:12:56.050
<v Speaker 1>him to sell sports shoes. He didn't sack workers who

0:12:56.090 --> 0:12:59.850
<v Speaker 1>opposed the Nazis. He even sheltered the half Jewish mayor

0:12:59.890 --> 0:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>of a nearby town. No, no, no, Rudy apparently tells

0:13:04.330 --> 0:13:08.210
<v Speaker 1>the committee Addie was a much nazier Nazi than that.

0:13:09.210 --> 0:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>He had our factory producing parts for pans and tanks.

0:13:12.890 --> 0:13:19.250
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't have happened with me in charge. The committee

0:13:19.290 --> 0:13:24.570
<v Speaker 1>deliver their verdict. They believe Addie. They class him as

0:13:24.610 --> 0:13:30.050
<v Speaker 1>a midlifer literally with Walker as opposed to a front runner,

0:13:30.810 --> 0:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>a sufficiently unenthusiastic Nazi, that they'll allow him to stay

0:13:35.330 --> 0:13:39.810
<v Speaker 1>in business. But it's painfully clear that Addie and Rudy

0:13:39.890 --> 0:13:43.850
<v Speaker 1>can't run that business together anymore. Rudy sets up shop

0:13:44.210 --> 0:13:47.850
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the river. The Dassler family

0:13:48.330 --> 0:13:52.890
<v Speaker 1>splits in two. Their mum goes with Rudy, their sister

0:13:53.250 --> 0:13:57.890
<v Speaker 1>stays with Addie. Their children stop seeing their cousins. The

0:13:57.970 --> 0:14:01.010
<v Speaker 1>employees are caught up in this family drama. They have

0:14:01.130 --> 0:14:04.610
<v Speaker 1>to choose a brother. Most of the sales team go

0:14:04.690 --> 0:14:08.530
<v Speaker 1>with the salesman Rudy. Most of the factory workers stay

0:14:08.530 --> 0:14:13.450
<v Speaker 1>with the technical Addie. They need names for their new ventures.

0:14:14.330 --> 0:14:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Adie decides to portmanteau his name Adidasler Addas. But there's

0:14:20.850 --> 0:14:24.050
<v Speaker 1>another shoe company called Adas, so Adie has to think

0:14:24.090 --> 0:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>again Adidas. Rudy has the same idea, Rudolph Asler Ruda.

0:14:31.730 --> 0:14:36.210
<v Speaker 1>He soon decides that Ruda's too boring and his nickname

0:14:36.530 --> 0:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>would be much cooler. Puma. The town of Herzogenaurach will

0:14:42.770 --> 0:14:49.890
<v Speaker 1>never be the same. Cautionary tales will return in a moment.

0:14:55.890 --> 0:15:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Adidas and Puma are both huge global brands. They're so

0:15:00.810 --> 0:15:04.610
<v Speaker 1>famous that it's easy to lose sight of how astonishing

0:15:04.690 --> 0:15:08.050
<v Speaker 1>it is that anyone has heard of either of them.

0:15:09.210 --> 0:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Think about the challenge that faced Rudy Asler and adid

0:15:12.290 --> 0:15:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Assler in nineteen forty eight. Rudy had just turned fifty,

0:15:17.210 --> 0:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Adie was only a couple of years younger. They'd spent

0:15:21.010 --> 0:15:24.530
<v Speaker 1>much of the last decade either producing things other than

0:15:24.570 --> 0:15:29.290
<v Speaker 1>sports shoes, such as parts for Panzer tanks, or justifying

0:15:29.330 --> 0:15:32.730
<v Speaker 1>what they'd done in the war. Rudy had a loyal

0:15:32.730 --> 0:15:36.330
<v Speaker 1>group of salespeople, but nobody making products for them to sell.

0:15:37.090 --> 0:15:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Adie had the makers, but nobody to sell what they made.

0:15:41.650 --> 0:15:44.770
<v Speaker 1>They were in a small town in Bavaria. In the

0:15:44.770 --> 0:15:48.730
<v Speaker 1>wake of the war. Germany was a pariah state, still

0:15:48.810 --> 0:15:53.450
<v Speaker 1>banned from international sporting events. Plenty of other companies in

0:15:53.570 --> 0:15:58.650
<v Speaker 1>other countries were making sports shoes too. With all these challenges,

0:15:59.330 --> 0:16:02.090
<v Speaker 1>what were the odds that either one of added ass

0:16:02.170 --> 0:16:05.850
<v Speaker 1>or Puma would turn into a multi billion dollar global

0:16:05.890 --> 0:16:10.890
<v Speaker 1>business empire. How did they both do it? Academics and

0:16:10.970 --> 0:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>management consultants, of course, take a keen interest in this

0:16:14.570 --> 0:16:19.290
<v Speaker 1>question of why some companies succeed and others don't. One

0:16:19.330 --> 0:16:24.690
<v Speaker 1>answer has to do with motivated employees. For example, here's

0:16:24.730 --> 0:16:30.330
<v Speaker 1>the consultancy firm McKinsey. People who find their individual purpose

0:16:30.530 --> 0:16:33.850
<v Speaker 1>congruent with their jobs tend to get more meaning from

0:16:33.890 --> 0:16:37.290
<v Speaker 1>their role, making them more productive and more likely to

0:16:37.410 --> 0:16:42.130
<v Speaker 1>outperform their peers. Purpose and meaning make us more productive.

0:16:43.050 --> 0:16:45.770
<v Speaker 1>But where do we get that sense of purpose and

0:16:45.850 --> 0:16:50.530
<v Speaker 1>meaning in our work? In twenty sixteen, researchers from UK

0:16:50.770 --> 0:16:56.050
<v Speaker 1>universities decided to try to find out. They interviewed over

0:16:56.090 --> 0:17:01.530
<v Speaker 1>one hundred people in diverse occupations, from nurses to lawyers

0:17:01.570 --> 0:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>to garbage collectors. First, they asked about demotivation. What are

0:17:07.490 --> 0:17:11.170
<v Speaker 1>some times at work when you found yourself thinking, what's

0:17:11.210 --> 0:17:16.730
<v Speaker 1>the point? People mention things like endless form filling, penny

0:17:16.770 --> 0:17:21.530
<v Speaker 1>pinching bosses, and a simple lack of recognition and respect.

0:17:22.210 --> 0:17:25.330
<v Speaker 1>A stonemason said that's how he feels when his manager

0:17:25.690 --> 0:17:30.490
<v Speaker 1>can't be bothered to say good morning. Then they asked

0:17:31.090 --> 0:17:33.530
<v Speaker 1>what are some times when you felt a sense of meaning.

0:17:34.370 --> 0:17:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Some of the workers talked about moments when they'd put

0:17:36.970 --> 0:17:40.850
<v Speaker 1>their work in a wider context, pausing to reflect on

0:17:41.010 --> 0:17:44.170
<v Speaker 1>what it's really all about and how it affects the

0:17:44.250 --> 0:17:48.450
<v Speaker 1>people around them. The stonemason recalled the end of a

0:17:48.490 --> 0:17:53.090
<v Speaker 1>project to restore a cathedral, when the scaffolding came down

0:17:53.730 --> 0:18:02.570
<v Speaker 1>and everyone said it looks amazing. The Stonemason is a

0:18:02.610 --> 0:18:06.330
<v Speaker 1>real life example of the parable of the three bricklayers,

0:18:06.650 --> 0:18:10.650
<v Speaker 1>which you'll often find trotted out in articles on finding

0:18:10.730 --> 0:18:14.970
<v Speaker 1>purpose at work. The parable goes like this. An architect

0:18:15.290 --> 0:18:20.610
<v Speaker 1>asks three bricklayers, what are you doing? Laying bricks, says

0:18:20.650 --> 0:18:24.530
<v Speaker 1>the first bricklayer, Putting up a wall, says the second.

0:18:25.450 --> 0:18:31.490
<v Speaker 1>The third bricklayer says, I'm building a cathedral. No prizes

0:18:31.530 --> 0:18:35.290
<v Speaker 1>for guessing which bricklayer the management gurus tell us will

0:18:35.330 --> 0:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>be most motivated and doing the best job. People feel

0:18:39.810 --> 0:18:43.290
<v Speaker 1>purpose at work, it seems, when they're reminded of how

0:18:43.370 --> 0:18:46.930
<v Speaker 1>their work contributes to a cause that means something to

0:18:46.970 --> 0:18:50.370
<v Speaker 1>the people they care about. I wonder how much that

0:18:50.530 --> 0:18:54.530
<v Speaker 1>helps to explain why two companies from a tiny town

0:18:55.250 --> 0:19:00.570
<v Speaker 1>both did so well. When Rudy and Addie split, every

0:19:00.690 --> 0:19:04.090
<v Speaker 1>worker had to choose a brother, and the split was

0:19:04.290 --> 0:19:07.850
<v Speaker 1>so acrimonious they must have felt sure that the other

0:19:07.930 --> 0:19:10.530
<v Speaker 1>brother would never forgive them all give them a job

0:19:10.530 --> 0:19:13.890
<v Speaker 1>in future if they needed one. In a small town

0:19:14.090 --> 0:19:19.370
<v Speaker 1>with two big employers who loathed each other, every single

0:19:19.490 --> 0:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>worker at Puma and Adidas must have been desperate to

0:19:24.570 --> 0:19:29.010
<v Speaker 1>prove they'd made the right choice. It's hard to imagine

0:19:29.010 --> 0:19:39.170
<v Speaker 1>a workforce more deeply invested in their company's success. In

0:19:39.250 --> 0:19:43.170
<v Speaker 1>his new base across the Arak River, Rudy Dassler's new

0:19:43.290 --> 0:19:48.210
<v Speaker 1>employees are soon putting in fourteen hour days even on

0:19:48.250 --> 0:19:54.090
<v Speaker 1>a Sunday. They call him father. His wife is Depuma Mutter,

0:19:54.450 --> 0:20:00.290
<v Speaker 1>the Puma Mother. We are one family. Rudy booms. He's

0:20:00.490 --> 0:20:05.490
<v Speaker 1>larger than life and full of bonomee. Sometimes he gets angry, too,

0:20:05.850 --> 0:20:09.890
<v Speaker 1>as Rolf Herbert Peters describes in his book The Puma Story,

0:20:11.090 --> 0:20:13.810
<v Speaker 1>in one meeting with staff to discuss a wage rise,

0:20:14.570 --> 0:20:17.210
<v Speaker 1>he takes off his jacket and snaps, do you want

0:20:17.210 --> 0:20:21.970
<v Speaker 1>the coat off my back? As well? In nineteen fifty,

0:20:22.450 --> 0:20:27.090
<v Speaker 1>West Germany's soccer team is allowed back into international competition.

0:20:27.930 --> 0:20:31.970
<v Speaker 1>The players wear whatever boots they want. The team's trainer

0:20:32.050 --> 0:20:35.370
<v Speaker 1>realizes that he's in a position to change that and

0:20:35.450 --> 0:20:39.330
<v Speaker 1>have them all play in the same boot that he

0:20:39.410 --> 0:20:44.290
<v Speaker 1>thinks could be worth something. He approaches Rudy with a proposition,

0:20:45.330 --> 0:20:49.010
<v Speaker 1>how about you pay me one thousand marks a month

0:20:49.090 --> 0:20:52.490
<v Speaker 1>for my services in today's terms a few thousand dollars.

0:20:53.970 --> 0:20:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Rudy is appalled by the idea. That's not how things

0:20:58.050 --> 0:21:01.970
<v Speaker 1>are done. I am deeply disappointed in you, he says.

0:21:02.810 --> 0:21:06.170
<v Speaker 1>The soccer team's trainer shrugs and goes to see Addie,

0:21:06.730 --> 0:21:09.810
<v Speaker 1>who sees that he's getting a bargain. At the next

0:21:09.890 --> 0:21:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Soccer World Cup, West Germany get to the final. As

0:21:14.610 --> 0:21:19.250
<v Speaker 1>the match time approaches, the heavens open the pitch will

0:21:19.290 --> 0:21:24.050
<v Speaker 1>become a quagmire. But Adidas have just introduced a new

0:21:24.170 --> 0:21:28.210
<v Speaker 1>model of soccer boot with different types of screwing studs.

0:21:28.970 --> 0:21:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The team's trainer calls him over, Addie studs on. Addie

0:21:34.290 --> 0:21:37.650
<v Speaker 1>gets the players to unscrew the shorter studs from their

0:21:37.650 --> 0:21:41.890
<v Speaker 1>boots and put in longer ones. They'll give more grip

0:21:41.930 --> 0:21:45.730
<v Speaker 1>in the muddy conditions. As the opposing teams slid and

0:21:45.810 --> 0:21:51.530
<v Speaker 1>slide around, West Germany score the winner three roles to two,

0:21:52.530 --> 0:21:57.170
<v Speaker 1>the trainer insists on bringing Addie into the team's victory photo.

0:21:57.610 --> 0:22:05.770
<v Speaker 1>The newspapers hail him as the nation's cobbler. Rudy is incensed.

0:22:06.690 --> 0:22:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't people know that Puma have also so just introduced

0:22:10.290 --> 0:22:14.450
<v Speaker 1>boots with screw on studs. Rudy and Addie are constantly

0:22:14.490 --> 0:22:17.610
<v Speaker 1>taking each other to court over who's copied whose idea.

0:22:18.410 --> 0:22:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Addie jokes that Rudy must look like a Swiss cheese,

0:22:22.130 --> 0:22:25.170
<v Speaker 1>because he keeps poking him to say that was my invention.

0:22:26.810 --> 0:22:31.450
<v Speaker 1>There's espionage. Rudy commissions a new machine for working leather,

0:22:31.970 --> 0:22:35.210
<v Speaker 1>but he's messed up the specifications. There's no good for

0:22:35.250 --> 0:22:39.810
<v Speaker 1>sports shoes. He's later amused to find out that Addie

0:22:39.930 --> 0:22:44.610
<v Speaker 1>ordered an identical machine and also discovered it didn't work.

0:22:45.410 --> 0:22:49.330
<v Speaker 1>There are dirty tricks. When Germany's star runner wins a

0:22:49.370 --> 0:22:54.450
<v Speaker 1>big race wearing Puma spikes, the next day's newspapers somehow

0:22:54.530 --> 0:22:58.210
<v Speaker 1>choose to print an old photo where he's wearing Adidas

0:22:59.170 --> 0:23:03.130
<v Speaker 1>at the nineteen fifty six Olympics in Melbourne. The consignment

0:23:03.290 --> 0:23:08.250
<v Speaker 1>of Puma shoes somehow gets held up in customs, while

0:23:08.250 --> 0:23:15.530
<v Speaker 1>the Adidas shoe whose don't at the Puma headquarters in Hurtzogenaurach.

0:23:16.090 --> 0:23:21.930
<v Speaker 1>You'd better not even say Adidas. They're called enng or

0:23:22.050 --> 0:23:27.690
<v Speaker 1>nicht genant, They who must not be named. Rudy quickly

0:23:27.770 --> 0:23:31.130
<v Speaker 1>understands that he can't afford to be disappointed in people

0:23:31.170 --> 0:23:35.370
<v Speaker 1>who ask for money to publicize his shoes. It's clearly

0:23:35.490 --> 0:23:40.090
<v Speaker 1>worth paying for celebrity endorsement, and that now opens up

0:23:40.130 --> 0:23:44.130
<v Speaker 1>a whole new front in the feud. At this point,

0:23:44.610 --> 0:23:48.610
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics is still supposed to be strictly amateur, no

0:23:48.770 --> 0:23:53.650
<v Speaker 1>commercial deals at all. Still, by nineteen sixty there's talk

0:23:53.730 --> 0:23:57.730
<v Speaker 1>of bonuses for winners with the right shoe on. One

0:23:57.810 --> 0:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>gold medalist tries to collect twice by running his race

0:24:01.650 --> 0:24:06.210
<v Speaker 1>in Puma, then changing into Adidas for the podium. By

0:24:06.250 --> 0:24:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the nineteen sixty four Olympics, things have moved on. Here's

0:24:10.730 --> 0:24:15.370
<v Speaker 1>an American athlete describing how it works. Like in James

0:24:15.370 --> 0:24:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Bond movies, a shoe agent goes into the bathroom and

0:24:18.770 --> 0:24:21.290
<v Speaker 1>leaves an envelope at the stall. I go in the

0:24:21.330 --> 0:24:24.730
<v Speaker 1>stall after him. You get an envelope that had six

0:24:24.970 --> 0:24:27.610
<v Speaker 1>seven hundred or a couple of thousand dollars in fives

0:24:27.690 --> 0:24:33.930
<v Speaker 1>and tens. You thought you're rich. In soccer, the industry

0:24:33.970 --> 0:24:37.810
<v Speaker 1>takes another step towards the modern day. The star of

0:24:37.850 --> 0:24:41.610
<v Speaker 1>the nineteen sixty six World Cup is a Portuguese player

0:24:41.730 --> 0:24:46.690
<v Speaker 1>called Usebo. Puma sign him up and launch a range

0:24:46.690 --> 0:24:49.930
<v Speaker 1>of boots with his name on them, the Eusebio King.

0:24:51.370 --> 0:24:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the first time their marketing has switched from buy

0:24:54.730 --> 0:24:59.290
<v Speaker 1>these boots because they're better to buy these boots because

0:24:59.330 --> 0:25:05.530
<v Speaker 1>someone famous wears them. By now Rudy and Addie are

0:25:05.570 --> 0:25:10.370
<v Speaker 1>getting old, the Dassler family feud has passed down a

0:25:10.490 --> 0:25:17.170
<v Speaker 1>generation to ADDIE's son Horst and Rudy's son Armin. ADDIE's

0:25:17.170 --> 0:25:22.170
<v Speaker 1>son Horst is brilliant, charming, and a workaholic. He calls

0:25:22.170 --> 0:25:26.570
<v Speaker 1>his executives at any hour of the night. One time

0:25:26.810 --> 0:25:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a spouse who answers the phone, Horst comes the voice.

0:25:31.610 --> 0:25:36.810
<v Speaker 1>You are interfering with my sex life. Rudy's son, Armin

0:25:37.090 --> 0:25:41.730
<v Speaker 1>wanted to study electronics. No way, said Rudy, you're getting

0:25:41.770 --> 0:25:47.370
<v Speaker 1>into sports shoes. Horst and Armine are barely on speaking terms,

0:25:47.970 --> 0:25:51.290
<v Speaker 1>but they do meet to make a gentleman's agreement that

0:25:51.610 --> 0:25:55.690
<v Speaker 1>neither will compete to sign up Pele, the most famous

0:25:55.730 --> 0:25:59.490
<v Speaker 1>soccer player of all. A bidding war for Pele would

0:25:59.490 --> 0:26:05.690
<v Speaker 1>break both companies. At the nineteen seventy Soccer World Cup,

0:26:06.050 --> 0:26:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Pele is about to kick off a match when he

0:26:08.850 --> 0:26:12.130
<v Speaker 1>tells the referee, wait a moment, I need to tie

0:26:12.170 --> 0:26:17.610
<v Speaker 1>my laces. All around the world, television screens zoom in

0:26:17.810 --> 0:26:22.850
<v Speaker 1>on Pla bending over to spend several seconds fiddling with

0:26:22.930 --> 0:26:30.330
<v Speaker 1>his boot, a brand new Pelee branded Huma boot. Puma

0:26:30.370 --> 0:26:32.810
<v Speaker 1>put them on sale for twenty percent more than the

0:26:32.930 --> 0:26:38.490
<v Speaker 1>exact same boot without Plas signature. The Pelle boot flies

0:26:38.530 --> 0:26:43.050
<v Speaker 1>off the shelves. Rudy's son Amin has pulled off a coup.

0:26:43.850 --> 0:26:51.530
<v Speaker 1>ADDIE's son Horse is fuman. Cautionary tales will be back

0:26:52.090 --> 0:27:02.810
<v Speaker 1>in a moment. As Rudy and Addie fought tooth and

0:27:02.970 --> 0:27:06.850
<v Speaker 1>nail to build their sportshoe empires, the little town of

0:27:06.930 --> 0:27:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Herzogenaurach became more more and more divided. Every family had

0:27:12.530 --> 0:27:16.210
<v Speaker 1>someone who worked for one brother or the other. As

0:27:16.210 --> 0:27:19.930
<v Speaker 1>they came home with tales about dirty tricks from the enemy,

0:27:20.410 --> 0:27:24.210
<v Speaker 1>their families became just as invested in their company's success.

0:27:25.490 --> 0:27:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Remember the mayor of Herzogenaurach, the one who later turned

0:27:29.930 --> 0:27:34.930
<v Speaker 1>up to watch soccer in diplomatically mismatched shoes as a kid.

0:27:34.970 --> 0:27:39.210
<v Speaker 1>He says, I had only Puma clothes. Wearing Adidas would

0:27:39.210 --> 0:27:44.210
<v Speaker 1>have been unthinkable. He's not exaggerating. Someone who moved from

0:27:44.250 --> 0:27:47.890
<v Speaker 1>another town to join one of the companies recalls he

0:27:47.970 --> 0:27:51.330
<v Speaker 1>had a restaurant. There was a Puma restaurant, an Adidas restaurant.

0:27:51.770 --> 0:27:54.330
<v Speaker 1>If you were working for the wrong company, you wouldn't

0:27:54.370 --> 0:27:57.530
<v Speaker 1>be served any food, so it was kind of an

0:27:57.530 --> 0:28:03.250
<v Speaker 1>odd experience. It wasn't just restauranteurs. There were bakers and

0:28:03.330 --> 0:28:06.210
<v Speaker 1>butchers who would serve you only if you had the

0:28:06.330 --> 0:28:10.890
<v Speaker 1>right brand of shoes on With Adidas, says one worker,

0:28:11.090 --> 0:28:13.530
<v Speaker 1>it simply didn't cross your mind to go into a

0:28:13.570 --> 0:28:18.170
<v Speaker 1>shop that you knew Puma workers frequented. Another longtime resident

0:28:18.250 --> 0:28:21.370
<v Speaker 1>recalls there was a time when you'd have risked the

0:28:21.410 --> 0:28:25.090
<v Speaker 1>wrath of colleagues and family if as an employee of

0:28:25.130 --> 0:28:29.810
<v Speaker 1>one company you married an employee of the other, still

0:28:30.210 --> 0:28:36.530
<v Speaker 1>he reckons. Without that intense local rivalry, neither company would

0:28:36.530 --> 0:28:39.810
<v Speaker 1>have reached such heights. If this is what motivation at

0:28:39.890 --> 0:28:45.490
<v Speaker 1>work can achieve, no wonder management consultants tell corporate clients

0:28:45.810 --> 0:28:57.650
<v Speaker 1>that it matters. When I was at college in the

0:28:57.690 --> 0:29:02.370
<v Speaker 1>mid nineteen nineties, recruiters from big companies like Unilever or

0:29:02.450 --> 0:29:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Procter and Gamble would invite undergraduates to presentations about what

0:29:07.130 --> 0:29:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like to work for their company, how to apply

0:29:09.810 --> 0:29:13.210
<v Speaker 1>for a job in their graduate training program. I went

0:29:13.250 --> 0:29:17.330
<v Speaker 1>to some of those presentations. At one, a recent graduate

0:29:17.570 --> 0:29:20.970
<v Speaker 1>explained the project they'd been working on developing a new

0:29:21.010 --> 0:29:25.170
<v Speaker 1>brand of ice Pop. They'd studied the market to understand

0:29:25.210 --> 0:29:28.810
<v Speaker 1>the brand positioning of existing ice pops. They'd talked to

0:29:28.850 --> 0:29:32.290
<v Speaker 1>focus groups of ice pop consumers to find out what

0:29:32.450 --> 0:29:35.490
<v Speaker 1>kind of adverts influenced them to buy one ice pop

0:29:35.690 --> 0:29:39.210
<v Speaker 1>or another, and they'd launched a new ice pop much

0:29:39.290 --> 0:29:41.810
<v Speaker 1>the same as all the other ice pops as a product,

0:29:41.890 --> 0:29:46.290
<v Speaker 1>but cleverly marketed. They did well. A good percentage of

0:29:46.410 --> 0:29:50.170
<v Speaker 1>ice pop buyers switched from competitors ice pops to their

0:29:50.210 --> 0:29:55.410
<v Speaker 1>ice Pop. The story was clearly meant to inspire. Apply

0:29:55.690 --> 0:29:58.610
<v Speaker 1>for a job with our company, and you too can

0:29:58.650 --> 0:30:02.930
<v Speaker 1>get to work on similar projects. The final PowerPoint slide

0:30:02.970 --> 0:30:08.090
<v Speaker 1>said you can make a visible difference. A cynical friend

0:30:08.170 --> 0:30:11.210
<v Speaker 1>leaned over and whispered in my ear. Surely, he said,

0:30:11.690 --> 0:30:15.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a typo that should read you can make a

0:30:15.650 --> 0:30:22.170
<v Speaker 1>risible difference. Remember the parable of the three bricklayers. We're

0:30:22.170 --> 0:30:25.570
<v Speaker 1>supposed to frown at the first bricklayer, the one who

0:30:25.610 --> 0:30:31.410
<v Speaker 1>said I'm laying bricks, not I'm building a cathedral. But

0:30:31.530 --> 0:30:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the whole parable is built on a line, which is

0:30:35.530 --> 0:30:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that everyone gets to work on a cathedral. Put yourself

0:30:42.610 --> 0:30:46.330
<v Speaker 1>in the position of a bricklayer who isn't building a cathedral,

0:30:46.650 --> 0:30:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but can only find work building a wall around a

0:30:49.770 --> 0:30:53.410
<v Speaker 1>parking lot in a nature reserve. What would you say

0:30:53.730 --> 0:30:56.610
<v Speaker 1>if someone asked you what you were doing. Maybe the

0:30:56.650 --> 0:31:00.930
<v Speaker 1>best response is to shrug and say, I'm laying bricks.

0:31:01.450 --> 0:31:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I do this job for the money. I look for

0:31:04.010 --> 0:31:09.210
<v Speaker 1>meaning and purpose elsewhere. The alternative is to persuade yourself

0:31:09.210 --> 0:31:12.730
<v Speaker 1>that what the world desperately needs is a parking lot

0:31:12.770 --> 0:31:16.970
<v Speaker 1>in a nature reserve. We can find meaning in almost

0:31:17.010 --> 0:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>anything if we try hard enough. We can care deeply

0:31:21.050 --> 0:31:25.250
<v Speaker 1>that people buy one ice pop not another. We can

0:31:25.290 --> 0:31:28.890
<v Speaker 1>feel personally fulfilled when we charge twenty percent more for

0:31:28.930 --> 0:31:31.530
<v Speaker 1>a soccer boot because we put Peli's name on it.

0:31:32.530 --> 0:31:36.010
<v Speaker 1>The consultants McKinsey tell us that when we see our

0:31:36.170 --> 0:31:40.290
<v Speaker 1>individual purpose in our work, will be more productive and

0:31:40.370 --> 0:31:45.050
<v Speaker 1>outperform our peers. Perhaps so, but if we take our

0:31:45.170 --> 0:31:48.890
<v Speaker 1>corporate jobs too much to heart, we might end up

0:31:49.050 --> 0:31:54.250
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically living in Hurtzoegenawak. And I put it to you

0:31:54.330 --> 0:31:58.770
<v Speaker 1>that Hurtzogenawak is not only a visible place, but a

0:31:58.850 --> 0:32:07.330
<v Speaker 1>dark and disturbing one too. Addie and Rudy Dassler both

0:32:07.410 --> 0:32:11.850
<v Speaker 1>died in their seventies. They're both buried in Herzegenawak's small

0:32:11.890 --> 0:32:18.890
<v Speaker 1>graveyard at opposite ends. Their sons, Horst and Armin never

0:32:19.010 --> 0:32:24.090
<v Speaker 1>buried the hatchet. ADDIE's son Horst once met Armin's son

0:32:24.210 --> 0:32:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Frank at a business event. There was no warmly avuncular greeting.

0:32:30.130 --> 0:32:34.090
<v Speaker 1>The German language has both formal and familiar ways of

0:32:34.130 --> 0:32:40.490
<v Speaker 1>saying you. Horst used the formal sea with me. Frank

0:32:40.570 --> 0:32:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Dasler remembers, I found that a little strange. Horst and

0:32:46.370 --> 0:32:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Armin both died young cancer. The workaholic Horst tried to

0:32:52.810 --> 0:32:57.210
<v Speaker 1>hide how ill he was. One colleague was stunned to

0:32:57.250 --> 0:33:01.530
<v Speaker 1>get a letter from Horst after he'd died. He'd still

0:33:01.570 --> 0:33:06.410
<v Speaker 1>been firing off business correspondence on his deathbed. In the end,

0:33:06.810 --> 0:33:11.010
<v Speaker 1>each branch of the family decided to sell up. Puma

0:33:11.130 --> 0:33:15.490
<v Speaker 1>became a publicly traded company in the nineteen eighties Adidas

0:33:15.730 --> 0:33:20.450
<v Speaker 1>a decade later. They outsourced production to countries where labor

0:33:20.570 --> 0:33:25.970
<v Speaker 1>was cheap. The two company's headquarters stayed in Herzogenaurach, but

0:33:26.090 --> 0:33:30.450
<v Speaker 1>the high powered employees often moved in from elsewhere. They

0:33:30.490 --> 0:33:35.890
<v Speaker 1>hadn't grown up with. This bitter divide slowly the animosity

0:33:36.010 --> 0:33:42.610
<v Speaker 1>in this small Bavarian town began to fade. In two

0:33:42.610 --> 0:33:47.370
<v Speaker 1>thousand and four, Rudy's grandson, Frank Dassler, took a job

0:33:47.410 --> 0:33:52.290
<v Speaker 1>as the head legal counsel for Adidas. A lot of

0:33:52.370 --> 0:33:56.970
<v Speaker 1>waters flowed under the bridge, said Frank. Others were appalled.

0:33:57.810 --> 0:34:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Rudy will be spinning in his grave, they said. One

0:34:03.210 --> 0:34:07.370
<v Speaker 1>longtime Puma employee with a Puma tattoo on his neck

0:34:07.650 --> 0:34:12.210
<v Speaker 1>told a journalist that Frank's new job was a capital sin.

0:34:14.530 --> 0:34:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Then in two thousand and nine, the CEO of Puma

0:34:18.890 --> 0:34:23.130
<v Speaker 1>picked up the phone to the CEO of Adidas. It's

0:34:23.410 --> 0:34:26.730
<v Speaker 1>peace day coming up, he said, I think it's about time,

0:34:26.810 --> 0:34:31.090
<v Speaker 1>after sixty years, to end this feud. How about doing

0:34:31.130 --> 0:34:36.850
<v Speaker 1>something together? And so two soccer teams emerged from the tunnel,

0:34:37.330 --> 0:34:40.370
<v Speaker 1>one in black, one in white, each kit with a

0:34:40.410 --> 0:34:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Puma logo on one side and Adidas on the other,

0:34:44.250 --> 0:34:48.330
<v Speaker 1>with the mare of Herzogenarak watching on, wearing a Puma

0:34:48.370 --> 0:34:50.890
<v Speaker 1>shoe on one foot and addied as on the other.

0:34:51.570 --> 0:34:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't humor versus Adidas to avoid a symbolic result.

0:34:56.490 --> 0:35:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Instead it was bosses versus workers. That perhaps the result

0:35:01.770 --> 0:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>was symbolic anyway of what happens when employees get their

0:35:05.490 --> 0:35:12.450
<v Speaker 1>purpose from their work. The bosses one, it's easy to

0:35:12.530 --> 0:35:17.050
<v Speaker 1>find corporate life depressing all the time and energy and

0:35:17.370 --> 0:35:21.450
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity that goes into pushing one brand of ice pop

0:35:21.570 --> 0:35:28.370
<v Speaker 1>or sports shoe over another. But sometimes, just sometimes, our

0:35:28.410 --> 0:35:34.050
<v Speaker 1>work presents a chance to set the cynicism aside. In

0:35:34.090 --> 0:35:38.850
<v Speaker 1>the late nineteen sixties, Addie Dassler heard about an American

0:35:38.930 --> 0:35:44.330
<v Speaker 1>high jumper called Dick Fosbury. He'd invented a new technique

0:35:44.370 --> 0:35:47.770
<v Speaker 1>for doing the high jump, twisting in the air and

0:35:48.090 --> 0:35:52.330
<v Speaker 1>arching his back over the bar, the Fosbury flop. People

0:35:52.370 --> 0:35:58.650
<v Speaker 1>called it dismissively at first, until they realized that it worked. Addie,

0:35:58.850 --> 0:36:01.970
<v Speaker 1>by now was an old man and a wealthy man,

0:36:02.610 --> 0:36:07.610
<v Speaker 1>the head of a business empire. But back in his youth,

0:36:07.650 --> 0:36:12.410
<v Speaker 1>remember he'd been a keen high jumper himself. He hadn't

0:36:12.490 --> 0:36:16.770
<v Speaker 1>forgotten what it meant to soar over the bar wearing

0:36:16.810 --> 0:36:21.090
<v Speaker 1>a good pair of shoes. Dick Fosbury had done something

0:36:21.130 --> 0:36:27.370
<v Speaker 1>which seemed totally original to Addie Dassler. He was captivated.

0:36:28.690 --> 0:36:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Addie phoned Dick Fosbury up. He wanted to know everything

0:36:33.330 --> 0:36:37.130
<v Speaker 1>about Fosbury's new technique, so he could think about exactly

0:36:37.170 --> 0:36:40.090
<v Speaker 1>what design of shoe and spikes might help him to

0:36:40.130 --> 0:36:43.410
<v Speaker 1>get the best run up and lift off. Then he

0:36:43.450 --> 0:36:47.770
<v Speaker 1>went into his workshop and made the shoes. He sent

0:36:47.850 --> 0:36:51.650
<v Speaker 1>them to Fosbury, who wore them at the nineteen sixty

0:36:51.650 --> 0:36:57.970
<v Speaker 1>eight Olympics and one. It was just amazing, said Fosbury,

0:36:58.170 --> 0:37:03.010
<v Speaker 1>that this German cobbler would spend hours on spikes just

0:37:03.090 --> 0:37:07.010
<v Speaker 1>for me. I was extremely grateful and certainly wouldn't dream

0:37:07.050 --> 0:37:11.210
<v Speaker 1>of accepting cash to wear them. It was a throwback

0:37:11.330 --> 0:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>to a more innocent age, the young Addie after the

0:37:16.050 --> 0:37:19.930
<v Speaker 1>First World War, inventing shoes that would help him to

0:37:19.970 --> 0:37:24.330
<v Speaker 1>be a better athlete. Approaching Jesse Owens in the Olympic

0:37:24.410 --> 0:37:27.930
<v Speaker 1>village not to slip him and envelope stuff with cash,

0:37:28.890 --> 0:37:33.730
<v Speaker 1>but simply to say, you're the best. Please try my shoes.

0:37:34.370 --> 0:37:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I hope you like them. As sixty seven year old

0:37:39.370 --> 0:37:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Addie Dassler sat in front of the television watching Dick

0:37:44.370 --> 0:37:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Fosbury leap his way to Olympic gold, he must have

0:37:49.330 --> 0:38:09.730
<v Speaker 1>felt like a Stonemason admiring a cathedral. Two wonderful histories

0:38:09.770 --> 0:38:13.450
<v Speaker 1>of Adidas and Puma are the Puma story by Rolf
